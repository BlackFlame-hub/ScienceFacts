                From the moment a person is born until they die,
                <b>science</b> plays an important role in their lives. In our
                daily lives, we use many <i>machines</i> that operate on the
                basic logic of science.
              </li>
              <li>
                Computers, satellites, x-rays, radium, plastic surgery, cell
                phones, electricity, the internet, photography, and other
                scientific <b>inventions</b> have proven extremely useful.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Science</strong> has enabled us to cope better with
                illnesses in the modern era. This has simplified our lives and
                extended our lives. These are the result of scientists’ hard and
                continuous inventions and theories.
              </li>
              <li>
                We travel from one location to another using various modes of
                transportation based on scientific discoveries, such as cars,
                buses, and trucks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Almost every day, either new <em>inventions</em> or improvements
                to existing ones are noted.
              </li>
              <li>
                Science has made work easier, safer, and more effective and

          <h2>Amazing Science Facts</h2>
          <section>
            <h4>The oceans produce the majority of the oxygen on Earth.</h4>
            <p>
              According to the <strong>National Oceanic Service</strong>
              <abbr title="National Oceanic Service">(NOS)</abbr> , we can thank
              plant-based marine organisms for all that fresh air. More than
              half of the world's oxygen is produced by plankton, seaweed, and
              other photosynthesizers.
            </p>
            <h4>Soil is full of life.</h4>
            <p>
              There are more <em>microorganisms</em> in one teaspoon of soil
              than people on the planet.
              <cite
                ><q
                  >Millions of species and billions of organisms—bacteria,
                  algae, microscopic insects, earthworms, beetles, ants, mites,
                  fungi, and more—represent the highest concentration of biomass
                  anywhere on the planet</q
                ></cite
              >
              according to the report.
            </p>
            <h4>Bananas are <strong>radioactive</strong></h4>
            <p>
              Bananas contain potassium, and because potassium decays, the
              yellow fruit becomes slightly radioactive.
            </p>
            <h4>Water can exist in three states at the same time.</h4>
            <p>
              This is known as the triple boil—or triple point—and it is the
              temperature and pressure at which materials exist as a gas, a
              liquid, and a solid all at the same time.
            </p>
            <h4>Helium has the ability to work against gravity.</h4>
            <p>
              When helium is cooled to near-absolute zero temperatures (-460
              <sup><mark>Fahrenheit</mark></sup> degrees or -273
              <sub><mark>Celsius</mark></sub> degrees ), it becomes a
              superfluid, which means it can flow without friction.
            </p>
            <h4>Humans have inherited genes from other species.</h4>
            <p>
              Our genome contains up to 145 genes mutated from bacteria, fungi,
              other single-celled organisms, and viruses.
            </p>
            <h4>Human Body</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The adult human body has 206 bones, while a child’s developing
                body has 300.
              </li>
              <li>
                The stapes, or stirrup bone, is the smallest bone in the human
                body, located in the middle ear. It measures approximately.11
                inches in length.
              </li>
              <li>
                Motor neurons are the longest cells in the human body. They can
                reach up to 4.5 feet in length and extend from the lower spinal
                cord to the big toe.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Animals and Insects</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The giant salamander is the world’s largest amphibian. It can
                grow to be 5 feet long.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fleas can jump 130 times their height. In human terms, that
                equates to a 6-foot-tall person leaping 780 feet into the air.
              </li>
              <li>
                Snakes are true carnivores because they only eat other animals
                and do not eat plants.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Sound</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Sound travels four times faster in water than it does in air.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cats have over 100 vocal sounds, whereas dogs only have about
                ten.

                Salt was so valuable to the ancient Romans that it was used as
                currency. Soldiers were paid in salt, which was also used for
                trading.

                <h4>What exactly is science?</h4>
                <p>
                  Science is a body of knowledge gained through the systematic
                  and logical study of any branch of knowledge, such as facts,
                  principles, or hypotheses, to open up new fields of knowledge.

                <h4>Is biology a branch of science?</h4>
                <p>
                  Biology is a branch of science that studies living organisms
                  and their vital processes.

                <h4>What is the significance of science in our lives?</h4>
                <p>
                  Science is one of the most important sources of information.
                  It serves a specific purpose and a variety of functions for
                  the benefit of our society, including the generation of new
                  knowledge, the improvement of education, and the enhancement
                  of our quality of life. Science must address societal needs as
                  well as global challenges.

                <h4>Is it possible to live without science?</h4>
                <p>
                  Without science, there is no human development, no
                  technological progress, no knowledge generation, and the world
                  stagnates. Science is knowledge, and the world as we know it
                  would not exist if we did not invest in science. The world
                  would come to a halt if science did not exist.
